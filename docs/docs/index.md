### Donate Back
the FTS team is working  daily on the development of a open and free solution. We plan to do more that simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server, our road map includes integration with open source systems like LORA's Meshtastic, porting it to Android, having an open API and much more.

We are doing it for free because we believe that donating personal time to a cause it's an endeavour that is worthy per-se,
however, part-time, we are also spending our own money to:

- Maintain a Public server and a test server
- Investing in different technologies for R&D

if you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times please consider to send you contribution here:

You can also support the project by buying one of our [T-Shirts](http://tee.pub/lic/elARpZYCmaw)

NOTE:
Not a big fan of Paypal, but that is the easier way I found for an initial attempt. 
We may go to some more ethical system in the future.
